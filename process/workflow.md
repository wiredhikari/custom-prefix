* Currently i have access PLCT lab's riscv machine via ssh, dlan's qemu image and riscv chroot env.

* I have logs of all 3 stages of a working gentoo prefix which I refer to while working, to understand what's coming next and for the reference on existing issues

* Using git lens to see older commit messages to unserstand the bootstrap-prefix.sh script is helpful too.

* Pulling my gentoo fork from prefix script (#todo)
    * In prefix script
